Changed from onionhash-0.0.2 to shallot-0.0.1:

* Fixed a 1KB memory leak.
* Removed irrelevant code.
* Brute force loop no longer mallocs/frees,  giving a ~1% increase in
    hashing speed.
* Now completely multithreaded, allowing systems with several CPUs to
    take full advantage of all of them to hash!
* Now follows PKCS#1 v2.1 for satisfactory public keys (previously on
    a version prior to v2.0, i.e. v1.5).
* BSD and Linux ports (required due to autodetecting core count).
