Shallot
=======

About
-----
Shallot allows you to create customized .onion addresses for [Tor's][tor]
[hidden services][hs].

By customized, it is meant that part of the address can be selected. Choosing an
entire address would take far longer than the universe is believed to have been
in existence.

Installation
------------
	$ ./configure && make
	$ ./shallot

Usage
-----
	$ ./shallot ^test

	-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

If you place the RSA private key (including its header and footer) in a file
called *private_key* in the `HiddenServiceDir` you specified in your torrc, (If
you don't know what that means, [read the Tor man page][tor-manual]. If you
*still* don't understand, Shallot probably isn't for you.) then when you restart
your Tor, a *hostname* file will be created in `HiddenServiceDir` that contains
your shiny new .onion address.

On the Security of Generated Host Names
---------------------------------------
It is sometimes said that host names generated by Shallot are less secure than
the host names generated by Tor. This is false. Shallot doesn't generate .onions
by doing anything different than Tor does, it just does it repeatedly. After a
while, you get a name that matches your requirements.

A History of Shallot
--------------------
Shallot has a long history in [Onion Land][hs]. In its original incarnation,
Shallot was originally written by a mysterious Onion Lander called Bebop, who
created its predecessor, tor-crypt-0.0.1, at some unknown time in the distant
past. That quickly(?) evolved into onionhash 0.0.2 and 0.0.3, until Bebop and
[Bebop's New Home in Onionspace](http://torlandypjxiligx.onion/) mysteriously
vanished. At this point, it was picked up by &#96;Orum, who gave Shallot its
current name, and went through three versions until &#96;Orum's site,
[hangman - hidden (in plan) site][hangman], went down. I (katmagic) got
Shallot's sources from [Tas's site][tasweb] and put them into a Git repository.
I made a few modifications, wrote a new README, and put the whole thing up on
GitHub for all to see.
